# The original file contained a copied JavaScript Firebase initialization snippet
# which is not a valid dotenv file. Vite expects key=value pairs in .env files.
#
# I created a new `.env.local` with the correctly formatted `VITE_` variables
# based on the values originally present here. `.env.local` is intended for
# local-only secrets and should not be committed to source control.
#
# If you prefer to restore the original JS snippet, you'll find it in
# `.env.bak` (created automatically). Otherwise keep the `.env.local` file
# and restart the dev server (npm run dev) so Vite picks up the new variables.
